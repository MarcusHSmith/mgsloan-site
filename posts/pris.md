synopsis: I made something. To do.

Lately I’ve been pondering a lot on what makes a good presentation,
and especially how to make good slides.
Most slides I see range from pretty bad to okay-ish.
Some are good.
Few are great.
A good presentation can have pretty standard slides.
Bullet points are not necessarily bad.
(How do I say this?)
Great slides are *designed*.

So when making slides, what do I want?
I want to be in control.
I want full control of where graphics and text are placed,
and over the typographic details.
Typesetting large paragraphs of text can and should be automated,
but good slides contain very little text.
Automatic line breaking is not actually that useful here.
Being a programmer,
I would like a system that plays nice with source control.
And finally,
I want to be able to tweak my slides with little effort.

Available tools
---------------

There is a plethora of tools for making slides.
I grew up with Powerpoint.
I’ve only recently come to realise that a graphical tool like Powerpoint
is actually very close to what I would want.
